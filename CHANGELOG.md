# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Added an AEMET regional-radar provider (Spain / western Mediterranean), first site Palma de Mallorca (`pm`, Balearic Islands), closing the Iberian coverage gap left by Radar-DPC/DWD/OPERA. Display tier only: reflectivity is reconstructed from the OpenData palette-GIF product (palette→dBZ) and geolocated by a coastline-matched linear EPSG:4326 fit, then served as EPSG:3857 tiles. Live-only (the API exposes no archive) and, per radar-provider-specification.md §7, it deliberately advertises no `downloadRaw`/`cellsFromRaw` from a rendered product. New dependency `omggif` (GIF decode); deterministic raster/contract tests and reproducibility scripts included.

## 2.5.9 - 2026-08-21

- Fixed Radar-DPC VMI/SRI/accumulated-rain overlays to render the current v2 time-qualified WebP data tiles instead of associating new REST timestamps with divergent legacy-WMS imagery; transport, decoding and palettes remain isolated in the Radar-DPC adapter.
- Migrated the independent Radar-DPC lightning event-map adapter from legacy WMS to the current v2 `LGT` binary frames, preserving map visualization without fabricating per-event timestamps for inference.
- Fixed Freeboard-SK lightning-layer activation state while keeping radar, lightning and inference providers independently pluggable.

## 2.5.8 - 2026-08-21

- Separated read-only operational routes from admin-only acquisition and prefetch operations, with truthful manual-operation responses and single-flight scheduling.
- Added component-specific prefetch/lightning error recovery and explicit lightning unavailability when own-ship position is missing.
- Enforced timestamp-aware onboard environment freshness and made global storm geometry antimeridian-safe.
- Completed and automatically validates the OpenAPI contract, strengthened lifecycle cleanup and expanded hardening regression coverage.

## 2.5.7 - 2026-08-20

- Fixed the installed Webapps dashboard icon while preserving the App Store icon by publishing the canonical asset at both required Signal K path bases.

## 2.5.6 - 2026-08-20

- Added explicit healthy, no-candidates, degraded and unavailable inference-cycle status; detector failure can no longer publish an all-clear.
- Radar frames are marked processed only after storm processing succeeds, allowing retry from archived raw evidence.
- Fixed zero inference/DNN weights and zero base uncertainty; weighted confidence is now cumulative and order-independent.
- Added area-weighted polygon/multipolygon centroids and adaptive vessel-path interception refinement.
- Fixed the packaged Signal K app-icon path and enabled Signal K integration coverage in CI.

## 2.5.5 - 2026-08-19

- Make root `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` explicit npm publish-manifest entries and enforce their inclusion in release-quality checks.

## 2.5.4 - 2026-08-19

- Correct the Signal K WebApp/App Store icon metadata to use a public-directory-relative square PNG, with deterministic path and image validation.

## 2.5.3 - 2026-08-19

- Follow the current Radar-DPC root REST routes and native HRD binary-product feed, including bounded publication-lag discovery and strict binary polygon validation.
- Expose the HRD binary endpoint in the Radar-DPC provider namespace and update the acquisition/reproducibility documentation for the current upstream contract.

## 2.5.2 - 2026-08-19

- Correct Radar-DPC latest-product discovery and raw-product downloads to use the documented `/wide/product` API routes, fixing the HRD background-acquisition HTTP 404 warning.
- Add deterministic coverage for Radar-DPC product discovery and raw-download request paths.
- Add a current Storm Intelligence Freeboard-SK integration screenshot to the operator documentation.

## 2.5.1 - 2026-08-18

- Complete the user-configurable lightning and onboard-environment evidence controls by exposing strike-to-cell association radius, lightning evidence weight and onboard sample freshness.
- Expose ensemble weights for the bundled deterministic inference algorithms and merge algorithm defaults before partial user overrides.
- Add configuration schema/default coverage tests and configuration maintenance rules to `AGENTS.md`.

## 2.5.0 - 2026-08-18

- Reject malformed, out-of-range, and future-dated lightning observations instead of treating them as fresh corroborating evidence.
- Add Signal K App Store metadata, a square application icon, an operational screenshot, current category keywords, and package discovery links.
- Add an explicit npm publish manifest that excludes contributor-only and local-development metadata while retaining tests and store assets.
- Add the reusable Signal K plugin CI workflow so install, load, activation, schema, lifecycle, package, platform, and test indicators appear in the App Store.
- Extend repository quality checks to enforce store assets, release notes, safe lifecycle scripts, and publish metadata.
- Upgrade `adm-zip` to 0.6.x to resolve the high-severity crafted-archive memory-allocation advisory reported by `npm audit`.

- Added ranked approaching-cell summaries with impact/closest-approach ETA, range, confidence, source, uncertainty and transparent 0-100 operational risk score.

- Kept Radar-DPC and DWD as bundled adapters exercising different upstream models.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-08-18

- Initial working Radar-DPC Signal K chart provider with VMI/SRI, XYZ-to-WMS proxy, latest/timeline endpoints and tests.

## 1.0.0 - Multisensor storm intelligence

- Added a provider-agnostic observation-provider registry, independent from weather-radar mosaic providers.
- Added a configurable generic HTTP/JSON lightning-strike adapter with URL templates, JSON array selection, field mapping, and optional HTTP headers.

- Added storm-cell/lightning association and lightning evidence in normalized threat confidence.
- Added onboard Signal K environmental fusion using true wind speed/direction, outside air temperature, and outside humidity when available.

- Added Freeboard status for Weather API observation availability and coverage.
- Added configuration for sampling radius/count, observation age and confidence weight.

## 1.3.0

- Multiple inference algorithms can participate in the same evidence cycle with ensemble strategies and per-algorithm provenance/status.
- Moved kinematic polygon tracking/interception and multisensor corroboration behind separate inference adapters.
- Added `/inference` and inference resource/status metadata.
- Added comprehensive `docs` documentation set, including normative radar/observation provider contracts, provider onboarding requirements, inference algorithm specification, architecture, Signal K/Freeboard integration, offline/storage, validation, security/licensing, and board-proposal notes.
- Added tests proving multiple algorithms coexist and a synthetic third algorithm can be added without core changes.
